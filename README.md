# Wordle-Solver
A script that solves Wordle for you!

You can download it as an extension for Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey in Chrome!


Check it out at: https://gist.github.com/MaxHjarpe/ca7e107b6ad70ff4ae2e7146fc22b176

Clicking the "Raw" button over at gist will take you directly to the download if you want to try it!


Be aware that the "reset" button clears localStorage! So if you have saved progress on the site that you want to keep, stay away from it. (Inactive as of now)
